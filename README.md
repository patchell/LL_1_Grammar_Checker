Readme.nd

This is a program to check an LL(1) Grammar for Left Recursion, 
Syntax errors, orphan productions, and conflicts.  This project
is done, as far as I am concerned.  There may be some updates
for bugs (not me!) and also to get rid of some of the dead 
weight.  There is some stuff in there that just
doesn't do anything.  There is a sample grammar (action.gram)
that has about 100 non terminals.
